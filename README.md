![](logo/deus_ex_silicium_256.png)

This repository contains materials, presentations, projects and software created for the course.

The course itself is an electronics course for begginers aimed at teaching stuff below the arduino - both digital and analog (eg. "how to create this sensor module" instead of "how to use this of the shelf sensor module"). It takes place at Hackerspace Tr√≥jmiasto in Poland with possibility to join via google hangout.
